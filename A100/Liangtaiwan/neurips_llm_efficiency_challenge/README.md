## Introduction
We are excited to participate in the NeuripsLLM Competition, aiming to push the boundaries of large language models (LLMs) using the powerful hardware provided. Our team, RevComm, comprises experts in the fields of natural language processing and machine learning. We have carefully reviewed the competition guidelines and timeline and have developed a comprehensive plan to tackle the challenges ahead.

## Competition Tracks
We will participate in both the Nvidia A100 and Nvidia 4090 tracks, making the most of the opportunity to leverage these cutting-edge GPUs for our LLM development.

## Technical Approach
### Model Development
Our strategy revolves around three key pillars: fine-tuning on instruction-tuning datasets, applying contrastive decoding methods, and exploring retrieval techniques. Each of these components is essential for creating a powerful LLM:

1. **Fine-tuning with FLAN v3 dataset:** We recognize the significance of fine-tuning on instruction-tuning datasets to enhance the performance of LLMs. Therefore, we plan to leverage FLAN v3 for fine-tuning, a powerful dataset that has demonstrated its effectiveness in previous works.

2. **Contrastive Decoding:** Contrastive decoding methods have been significantly improve LLM performance across various tasks. Our team will explore and implement these methods to make our models more versatile and effective.

3. **Retrieval Techniques:** While the provided resources for storage are limited, we understand the importance of retrieval techniques in enhancing the robustness of LLMs. We will explore innovative ways to make the most of the available resources for retrieval, ensuring that our models can read and understand multiple retrieved documents.

### Evaluation and Testing
We will rigorously evaluate our models using HELM, the standard suite for LLM evaluation. HELM offers a broad set of datasets, including both standard STEM tasks and heldout tasks unique to this competition. We will host an LLM server to enable the evaluation of multiple tasks within the HELM framework.

## Milestones
Our progress will be structured around the following milestones:

1. **Model Development:** We will start by fine-tuning our models on the LLama2 and implement contrastive decoding techniques.

2. **Retrieval Techniques:** Simultaneously, we will try to incorporate retrieval techniques within the resource constraints provided by the competition.

3. **Evaluation and Testing:** We will continually evaluate our models using HELM, adjusting and fine-tuning them as needed based on the evaluation results.

4. **Documentation and Reporting:** Throughout the competition, we will maintain comprehensive documentation of our progress, challenges faced, and solutions developed. We will regularly report our findings and results to the competition organizers and the community.

## Conclusion
RevComm is committed to pushing the boundaries of LLMs in the NeurIPS Large Language Model Efficiency Challenge. Our team possesses the expertise and determination to excel in both the Nvidia A100 and Nvidia 4090 tracks. We will leverage fine-tuning, contrastive decoding, and retrieval techniques to create robust and high-performing models. By adhering to the competition guidelines and timeline, we aim to achieve outstanding results and contribute to the advancement of LLM research.

We look forward to the competition and the opportunity to collaborate with fellow participants to make significant strides in the field of large language models.
