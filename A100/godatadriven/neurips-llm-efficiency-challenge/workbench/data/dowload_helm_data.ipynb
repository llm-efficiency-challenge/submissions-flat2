Flooding has affected more than 1.5 million people in parts of India, said the disaster management division of the federal home ministry. The country's main weather office has warned of more heavy rain in western and central parts of India. Monsoon rains sweep across the subcontinent from June till September. Though they bring much-needed relief to often-parched farmlands, they also leave a trail of landslides, home collapses and floods that can kill. In neighboring Pakistan, torrential monsoon rains left more than three dozen people dead and broke a 32-year record over the weekend. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.\n",

The 13-inch by 8 5/8-inch framed photograph was purchased by an anonymous bidder over the phone. The full frontal photograph was one of several taken by American photographer Lee Friedlander in 1979.

    "          Article: Arsene Wenger wants Cesc Fabregas to be shown the ‘respect he deserves’ when he returns to the Emirates Stadium in the blue of Chelsea on Sunday. The problem with that is a decent chunk of Arsenal’s supporters feel he doesn’t deserve much. That became obvious on Thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a Fabregas banner from the Ken Friar Bridge. Cesc Fabregas returns to Arsenal on Sunday and Arsene Wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants 'respect' for the club's former players and counts Fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to Fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where Fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from Barcelona to Chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on Thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player, saying: ‘We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.’ When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added: ‘It’s not as clean as that. I cannot speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on Sunday.’ At that point it was suggested to Wenger that Fabregas chose not to come back and Wenger said: ‘I don’t know, I don’t know.’ The Frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew Fabregas was available, a deal with Chelsea was virtually concluded — comments which jarred a little with the Spaniard’s statement last summer that Arsenal ‘decided not to take’ their option. Whatever, it would be ambitious for Fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on Sunday. The midfielder set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Certainly, there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011. But Wenger said: ‘I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday, (I want him) to be respected like he deserves.’ Wenger added: ‘The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here.’ When he returns, it will be as a key part of the champions-elect and under a manager in Jose Mourinho who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with Wenger. That clash, in itself, is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second-placed teams in the Barclays Premier League. Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 .\n",

    "          A: On 80 games, Daniel spend 80 games * $12/game = $<<80*12=960>>960. The rest of the collection is 346 games - 80 games = <<346-80=266>>266 games. 50% of these games means 50/100 * 266 games = <<50/100*266=133>>133 games. Daniel bought them for $7 each, so he had to spend 133 games * $7/game = $<<133*7=931>>931 on them. The other 133 games were bought for $3 each, so they've cost him 133 games * $3/game = $<<133*3=399>>399. On all games in total Daniel spent $960 + $931 + $399 = $<<960+931+399=2290>>2290.

    "          A: The number of roses in the bunch is 2/5 * 40 flowers = <<2/5*40=16>>16 flowers The total number of roses and tulips is 16 flowers + 10 flowers = <<16+10=26>>26 flowers There were 40 flowers - 26 flowers = <<40-26=14>>14 carnations The answer is 14.\n",

    "          A: Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100 Therefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100 Therefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25 The answer is 25.\n",

    "          Q: Betty is growing parsnips in her vegetable garden. When the parsnips are grown, they are harvested and bundled into boxes that can hold up to 20 parsnips each. Each harvest, three-quarters of the boxes are full, and the remaining boxes are half-full. She gets an average of 20 boxes each harvest. How many parsnips does Betty grow in an average harvest?\n",
    "          A: If three-quarters of the boxes are full, then 1 – ¾ = ¼ of the boxes are half-full. On average, each harvest therefore has 20 boxes * 0.25 = <<20*0.25=5>>5 boxes that are half-full. This leaves 20 total boxes – 5 half-full boxes = <<20-5=15>>15 full boxes. Half-full boxes hold 20 parsnips / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 parsnips each. In total, the half-full boxes, therefore, hold 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = <<5*10=50>>50 parsnips. The full boxes hold a total of 15 boxes * 20 parsnips = <<15*20=300>>300 parsnips. So Betty harvests a total of 50 + 300 = <<50+300=350>>350 parsnips in an average harvest. The answer is 350.\n",

It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?\n",
