She doesn't want to spend much, so she called 3 salons to get their prices: Gustran Salon, Barbara's Shop, and The Fancy Salon. At Gustran Salon, the haircut is $45, the facial cleaning is $22 and the nails are $30. At Barbara's shop, the nails are $40, the haircut is $30 and the facial cleaning is $28. And, at the Fancy Salon, the facial cleaning is $30, the haircut is $34 and the nails are $20. How much would Haily spend at the cheapest salon?\nA: So first, we should add the prices of all salons. At Gustran Salon, the total price is: $45 + $22 + $30 = $<<45+22+30=97>>97 The total price at Barbara's shop is: $40 + $30 + $28 = $<<40+30+28=98>>98 The total price at The Fancy Salon is: $30 + $34 + $20 = $<<30+34+20=84>>84 At Gustran salon she would spend $97, at Barbara's Shop she would spend $98, and at The Fancy Salon she would spend $84, so she would spend $84 at the cheapest salon. The answer is 84.\n\nQ: A crayon box has 24 crayons total.  8 crayons are red, 6 crayons are blue, there are 2/3 the number of green crayons as blue crayons, and the rest of the crayons are pink.  How many crayons are pink?\nA: There are 2/3 green crayons * 6 blue crayons = <<2/3*6=4>>4 green crayons. The pink crayons left in the box are 24 crayons total - 8 red - 6 blue - 4 green = <<24-8-6-4=6>>6 pink crayons. The answer is 6."
