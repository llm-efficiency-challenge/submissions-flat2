Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene.\\nThe family moves to Chatham, after Ben is ordered back with his detachment. Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting the help of her mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster.\\nWhen Percival is a young teenager, Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival--unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity.\\nAfter his reappearance aboard the ship, Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar. His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao. He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer, effectively saving the captain's life. At this point, the captain receives news that his older brother has died, making him the new Lord de Versely, and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner. After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship, Percival is promoted to captain. During his service in the Navy, Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth, and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Curaรงao to convince his fellow officers they've been poisoned. He also keeps correspondence with Minnie, developing a romance with the beautiful heiress.\\nNear the end of the story, Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged. After being saved by another English vessel, he receives a letter informing him of Lord de Versely's sudden death from heart complications and learns that he has been left all of his personal property. Percival is still disappointed that he can not take his father's name. He later journey's with his friend Bob Cross to Hamburg to reunite with Minnie, but is captured by French troops on the road and sentenced to execution for spying. During a skirmish between the French and the Cossacks, Percival and Cross are able to escape and continue on the road. At the end of the novel, Percival proposes to Minnie, and stands to inherit a great fortune through her father. He also receives a letter from the de Versely attorney letting him know he has been granted the arms and name of Delmar.\\nQuestion: Who did Percival reunited with?\", multimedia_content=None), references=[Reference(output=Output(text='Minnie', multimedia_content=None), tags=['correct']), Reference(output=Output(text='minnie', multimedia_content=None), tags=['correct'])], split='train', sub_split=None, id=None, perturbation=None, contrast_inputs=None, contrast_references=None)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":92}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["narrative_qa = []\n","\n","for _, instance in enumerate(instances):\n","    if len(narrative_qa) > ADD_LIMIT:\n","        break\n","\n","    inputs = f\"Passage: {instance.input.text}\\nAnswer: \"\n","    response = [f\"{ref.output.text}\" for idx, ref in enumerate(instance.references) if ref.tags != [] and ref.tags[0] == 'correct'][0]\n","    point = {\"inputs\": inputs, \"response\": response}\n","    narrative_qa.append(point)\n","\n","len(narrative_qa)"],"metadata":{"id":"1CGBMkDOq3kz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698223539065,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Ngo","userId":"16920359324609725074"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"ad352083-cca3-442e-ff0e-9dedfa0c7ce8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1501"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":93}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["narrative_qa[10]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5Fzw-koQ7jOl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698223539065,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Ngo","userId":"16920359324609725074"}},"outputId":"96ce9911-631e-4d80-86e4-1e7b21d93e0d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'inputs': \"Passage: In December 1995, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is a time-obsessed systems engineer, who travels worldwide resolving productivity problems at FedEx depots. He is in a long-term relationship with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), with whom he lives in Memphis, Tennessee. Although the couple wants to get married, Chuck's busy schedule interferes with their relationship. A Christmas with relatives is interrupted when Chuck is summoned to resolve a problem in Malaysia. While flying through a violent storm, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Chuck escapes the sinking plane and is saved by an inflatable life-raft but loses the raft's emergency locator transmitter. He clings to the life-raft, loses consciousness, and floats all night before being washed up on an island. After he awakens, he explores the island and soon discovers that it is uninhabited.\\nSeveral FedEx packages from the crashed plane wash up on the shore, as well as the corpse of one of the pilots, which he buries. He initially tries to signal for rescue and makes an escape attempt with the remnants of his life-raft but cannot pass the powerful surf and the coral reefs surrounding the island. He searches for food, water, shelter, and opens the packages, finding a number of potentially useful items. He leaves one package, with a pair of angel wings stenciled on it, unopened. During a first attempt to make fire, Chuck receives a deep wound to his hand. In anger and pain, he throws several objects, including a Wilson volleyball from one of the packages. A short time later he draws a face in the bloody hand print on the ball, names it Wilson, and begins talking to it. One night, Chuck calculates that in order for the rescue workers to find the site of the plane crash, they'll have to search an area twice the size of Texas, making him doubtful he will ever be found.\\nFour years later, Chuck is dramatically thinner, bearded, with longer hair, and wearing a loincloth. He has become adept at spearing fish and making fires. He also has regular conversations and arguments with Wilson, his volleyball friend which has become his only means of socialization. A large section from a portable toilet washes up on the island; Chuck uses it as a sail in the construction of a raft. After spending some time building and stocking the raft and deciding when the weather conditions will be optimal (using an analemma he has created in his cave to monitor the time of year), he launches, using the sail to overcome the powerful surf. After some time on the ocean, a storm nearly tears his raft apart. The following day, Wilson falls from the raft and is cast away into the ocean, leaving Chuck crying and overwhelmed by loneliness. Later, a passing cargo ship finds him, drifting.\\nUpon returning to civilization, Chuck learns that he has long been given up for dead; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral, and Kelly has since married Chuck's one-time endodontist and has a daughter. After reuniting with Kelly, the pair profess their love for each other but, realizing they can't be together because of her commitment to her new family (and also remembering that Chuck wasn't there for her last time), they sadly part. Kelly gives Chuck the keys to the car they once shared.\\nSometime later, after buying a new volleyball, Chuck travels to Canadian, Texas to return the unopened FedEx package with the angel wings to its sender, a woman named Bettina Peterson. The house at the address is empty, so he leaves the package at the door with a note saying that the package saved his life. He departs and stops at a remote crossroads. A friendly woman (Lari White) passing by in a pickup truck stops to explain where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the angel wings on the back of her truck is identical to the one on the parcel. As Chuck is left standing at the crossroads he looks down each road, then smiles faintly as he looks in the direction of the woman's truck.\\nQuestion: Who is the only friend Chuck talks to on the island?\\nAnswer: \",\n"," 'response': 'Wilson'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":94}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Medical"],"metadata":{"id":"0_1yvTx48uN-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from helm.benchmark.scenarios.med_mcqa_scenario import MedMCQAScenario\n","\n","instances = MedMCQAScenario().get_instances(\"med_mc_qa\")\n","random.shuffle(instances)\n","print(len(instances))\n","instances[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"MK449yTb7jRu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698223548272,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":9217,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Ngo","userId":"16920359324609725074"}},"outputId":"12ac95a8-21ae-4dc4-f9e0-7d68bacd39c3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ensure_file_downloaded {\n","  Not downloading https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=15VkJdq5eyWIkfb_aoD3oS8i4tScbHYky&confirm=t because med_mc_qa/data already exists\n","} [0.002s]\n","187005\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Instance(input=Input(text='Regarding cysticercosis all are true except,', multimedia_content=None), references=[Reference(output=Output(text='Commonest sites are meninges and cerebral ventricle', multimedia_content=None), tags=['correct']), Reference(output=Output(text='Calcification is common', multimedia_content=None), tags=[]), Reference(output=Output(text='Caused by larval stage of Taenia solium', multimedia_content=None), tags=[]), Reference(output=Output(text='Causes focal neurological complication', multimedia_content=None), tags=[])], split='train', sub_split=None, id=None, perturbation=None, contrast_inputs=None, contrast_references=None)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":95}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["med_mc = []\n","\n","for i, instance in enumerate(instances):\n","    if len(med_mc) > ADD_LIMIT:\n","        break\n","    choices = '\\n'.join([f\"{chr(65 + idx)}. {ref.output.text}\" for idx, ref in enumerate(instance.references)])\n","    inputs = f\"Question: {instance.input.text}\\n{choices}\\nAnswer: \"\n","    response = '\\n'.join([f\"{chr(65 + idx)}. {ref.output.text}\" for idx, ref in enumerate(instance.references) if ref.tags != [] and ref.tags[0] == 'correct'])\n","    point = {\"inputs\": inputs, \"response\": response}\n","    med_mc.append(point)\n","\n","len(med_mc)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RxMJlqIj7jUd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698223548273,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":13,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Ngo","userId":"16920359324609725074"}},"outputId":"6e8def50-a176-4668-9749-d6e833a77941"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1501"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":96}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["med_mc[10]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"27jt4Dhk7jXV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698223548273,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Chris Ngo","userId":"16920359324609725074"}},"outputId":"c500993e-2941-4ce1-c9c0-50e78f6aaea0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'inputs': 'Question: Which of the following is true about the Periodontal Index?\\nA.

But they are just some of the disputes he was involved in. The minister came to power with the Fine Gael/Labour coalition in February 2011, four months after the Republic of Ireland was forced to accept a humiliating international financial bail-out. Mr Shatter, a lawyer, was put in charge of two government departments - justice and defence. As the Republic of Ireland introduced painful austerity measures, the new justice minister set out on a wide-ranging reform agenda, which included plans to close more than 100 police stations. But, in May 2013, the justice minister became embroiled in a public row that generated so much attention it became popularly known as Shattergate. The minister was taking part in a TV debate about alleged police corruption in the penalty points system, following claims officers inappropriately wiped points from the driving licences of often well-connected offenders. His opponent in the debate was the independent parliamentarian Mick Wallace who had made claims that sports stars, journalists and others appeared to have their driving penalties waived. Mr Shatter accused his opponent of hypocrisy. He informed viewers that Mr Wallace had himself benefited from police discretion on a penalty points offence, having been observed using his mobile phone at a set of traffic lights in Dublin. There was no formal reprimand or police record of the event, so Mr Wallace wanted to know how the minister could have known about it. Mr Shatter said his information source was the then police chief, Martin Callinan, resulting in more questions over the minister\\'s close working relationship with the country\\'s top police officer - not for the first nor last time. Within days, the justice minister faced questions in parliament about claims he had once failed to provide an alcohol breath test at a police road checkpoint in Dublin. In a written statement, Mr Shatter replied that he failed to complete the breathalyser test because of his asthmatic condition and was waved on by officers. He denied he had taken alcohol before getting into his car and said he was returning home from the Irish parliament. Under Irish law, elected members going about parliamentary business cannot be arrested. However, Mr Shatter was then accused of abusing parliamentary privilege in refusing to submit to the breath test. The country\\'s main opposition party, Fianna Fáil, tabled a motion of no confidence in the justice minister, but it was defeated on 29 May 2013. In December 2013, Mr Shatter issued an unreserved apology on behalf of the state after a major public inquiry found that Irish police officers had colluded in the IRA murders of two senior Northern Ireland policemen in 1989. The Smithwick Tribunal investigated allegations of collusion by the country\\'s police force, An Garda Síochána, in the killings of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers, Supt Bob Buchanan and Ch Supt Harry Breen. The RUC officers were shot dead by the IRA as they returned from a meeting at Dundalk Garda station. The tribunal, and indeed the murders, had preceded Mr Shatter\\'s tenure as justice minister by many years, but he was still caught up in controversy. In June 2011, tribunal chairman Judge Peter Smithwick accused the minister of trying to interfere with the independence of the public inquiry. The judge, opposition politicians and unionist representatives at Stormont objected to Mr Shatter\\'s attempt to impose deadlines on the only Troubles-related public inquiry to take place in the Republic of Ireland. The justice minister has also had a tense relationship with the Garda Representative Association (GRA), which represents rank and file police officers. In 2013, the GRA passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Shatter and refused to invite him to address its annual conference. It was the first time in the GRA\\'s history that the organisation snubbed an Irish justice minister in such a way. Over recent months, Mr Shatter has been heavily criticised for his handling of claims that the office of the Irish police watchdog may have been bugged. A security sweep of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission\\'s (GSOC) offices suggested evidence of electronic surveillance in a meeting room and a compromised wi-fi system. The sweep was carried out last year, but details emerged months later in a Sunday Times newspaper report. It also emerged that GSOC had not informed either the police or the justice minister about the findings of the security operation. Mr Shatter publicly criticised the ombudsman for not informing him, but the opposition accused the minister of treating GSOC as the villain, not the victim, of the bugging controversy. Meanwhile, the actions of two police whistleblowers, who made allegations that there was widespread abuse of the penalty points system, were described as \"disgusting\" by Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan. When an independent report largely vindicated the whistleblowers, there were calls for the police chief to retract his \"disgusting\" remarks. Mr Callinan refused to back down and weathered the criticism for three months. But on 25 March, he resigned unexpectedly. Within hours, the timing of his resignation became clear as a new controversy engulfed both the police and the department of justice. The government announced it was setting up an inquiry into revelations that telephone calls to and from many police stations had been secretly recorded, without the knowledge of either officers or callers. It later emerged there were about 2,500 secret tapes still in existence, some dating from as far back as the 1980s. Witnesses in criminal investigations are among those whose conversations were secretly recorded and the revelations could have major implications for current and completed court cases. Opposition politicians repeated their calls for Mr Shatter to step down, but on 2 April, a second motion of no confidence was defeated in parliament by 95 votes to 51. This week, the penalty points row and the Garda whistleblowers controversy came back to bite the minister. On Tuesday, Data Protection Commissioner Billy Hawkes ruled that Mr Shatter had broken data protection laws during his TV spat with Mick Wallace. The commissioner ruled the minister should not have disclosed personal information about Mr Wallace, namely telling viewers that the independent TD had been cautioned by police for using his mobile phone while driving. But it was Mr Shatter\\'s handling of the whistleblowers\\' case that finally caused his downfall. On Wednesday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny told a stunned parliament that Mr Shatter had resigned following the government\\'s receipt of a report into allegations made by Sgt Maurice McCabe. Mr Kenny said his colleague had taken responsibility after the report criticised a number of agencies, including the police, the Department of Justice and the minister himself. However, the man who has been dubbed the \"minister for self-defence\" did not leave without a parting shot. In his resignation letter, Mr Shatter said he disputed some aspects of the report. He added that he \"would have expected\" the author Sean Guerin SC to interview him before reaching a conclusion.
